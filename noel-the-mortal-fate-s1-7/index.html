style="border:none;margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />Barely escaping, Noel and Caron swim to a hideout – a place Caron knows well.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />In this "hideout," there are many traces of Caron and a certain someone living here.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />After being confronted by Noel with evidence, Caron begins to speak of his past with “that person" he once made a contract with.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />And the shocking truth was revealed...<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/850000/extras/_04.png?t=1528900723" style="border:none;margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />Now marked as terrorists, a police officer, claiming to be "the Demon of Justice", appears before Noel and Caron.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />To avenge a personal grudge, a young man called Oscar D, begins to attack Noel and Caron with a mysterious ability.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />In addition to the movements of the police, Jillian takes action to save Noel.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />The girl and devil's revenge move to a whole new level with the entanglement of various characters’ intentions.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/850000/extras/_05.png?t=1528900723" style="border:none;margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />After a desperate battle with Oscar D, Caron is taken away from Noel.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />Left alone in a hopeless situation, Noel finds hope in one man...<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />The Bomber who once confronted Noel and Caron – the Demon of Explosions – "Fugo Dressel."<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />Noel breaks into the facility imprisoning Bomber by herself.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />But will Noel be able to take back Caron?<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/850000/extras/_06.png?t=1528900723" style="border:none;margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />With the help of the former enemy, Bomber, Noel rescues Caron.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />This was also the moment when Caron and Noel finally gain a fellow "member."<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />And now, Noel's next goal is to take down Burrow's funding source, the Casino "Misty."<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />Disguised in uniforms, Noel and the others sneak in.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />Take down the Casino swirling in conspiracy by using "cheats!"<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/850000/extras/_07.png?t=1528900723" style="border:none;margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />Burrows loses his important source of funds as Casino "Misty" goes up in flames. <br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />With a weakening police force, Noel and the others decide this is the time for the biggest attack.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />The day chosen for the final battle, is the one that changed Noel's fate…<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /></span><br /><ul class="bb_ul" style="list-style-type:square;margin:0 0 0 16px;padding:0;"><span
