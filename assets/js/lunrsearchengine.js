Bereft of his past, Adol explores the town he happened to wander into, searching for any clues at all to his identity. Joined by a thief who claims to have spent some time at his side these past weeks, the young adventurer helps rescue doomed miners from a collapse – an act which ingratiates him to the local Romun Army general. Impressed with their skills, the pair is enlisted to explore the Great Forest of Celceta and map its vast expanses – a task which many have attempted in the past, but from which none have ever returned alive. Eager to unravel the mystery of his past and the cause of his predicament, Adol sets off with his new-old thief friend, Duren, to chart the untamed wilderness that claimed his memories. Along the way he meets numerous other individuals who seem to have encountered him before, and must carefully determine who among them can be trusted. Developer Nihon Falcom originally revisited the land and characters of Japanese cult favorite Ys IV in 2012 with Ys: Memories of Celceta on the PlayStation Vita, and the game found its way to North America the following year. Now, this re-envisioning moves from the small screen to PC monitors, with a bevy of updates and enhancements to fully take advantage of its new platform.

He lives a peaceful student life, participating in the library committee and helping out at Yuuhi’s family business, the Yuugaotei cafe, after school. Until one day. Tomoki stops by a used bookstore called Fuurindou, near the shopping district, to look for a book recommended to him by Ayase Sayuki, the chairman of the library committee and an upperclassman he admires. Tomoki isn’t surprised to find the interior of the store a match for the deteriorating exterior. The air is humid, the bookshelves are black with dirt, and the many books are covered in dust. Even so, it would be a shame to leave without at least a look around, so he goes hunting for the book he’s after. He wanders around the shop for a little while, casting his eyes about until a certain book catches them. On that back of that old book are the words “your diary”.  Strangely curious, he picks it up, turns it over to the cover, and——A girl pops out, in a wash of warm light. “Are you Yua’s new friend?”After he meets Yua, the strange girl who claims to be a god, destiny begins to move for Tomoki—and for the girls around him.

The cause of the illness was a virus, currently classified into two types: the  A-Virus  and  V-Virus . The world government enacted a law to care for patients infected with the Virus. Five secret artificial islands were established to quarantine the infected patients. One such quarantine island: Bhikkhuni, the island famous for successfully controlling the  V-Virus . Girls who enroll in Bhikkhuni's school can overcome the virus. And thus, it is a school with many hopeful applicants. Among them is a pair of sisters infected with the  V-Virus . The elder Rinka Kagurazaka, whose innocent grace hides power within. The younger Ranka Kagurazaka, whose outgoing energy belies her frailty.

She introduced herself as the Goddess that protects the island, and said that Claire had the power of the Hero within her. She said that while everyone was scrambling for treasure, a villain who sought to bring the world to ruin had also begun to search for it.

Among other entries in the genre such as Ib and Ao Oni, The Witch’s House surprised fans with pixel-art that conceals truly frightening horror.  The Witch’s House is deliberately designed with traps at *almost* every turn--sudden death is unpredictable and it keeps players on their toes. Anything can happen at any time. With completely remastered visuals, The Witch’s House MV will feel fresh to even the most familiar old-school fans. Fans will also be greeted by a new difficulty mode that includes new events upon completion of the base game. A horror atmosphere wherein players solve puzzles based on clues found in the house. Completely reimagined graphics that make for a beautifully terrifying experience. Brand new unlockable difficulty mode with new events and dialogue. Violence and gore that are not recommended for the squeamish. Player discretion advised. Sudden deaths that lurk around every corner and await every misstep. Items must be used deliberately as players solve the puzzles for themselves. Fixed save points (just keep an eye out for the talking black cat). Game pads are supporting and recommended. Head phones *strongly* recommended. Hello. I'm Fummy, creator of The Witch's House MV. I'm happy to announce that we're finally ready to release the game. The Witch's House MV is an RPG Maker MV remake of the original game, which was released back in 2012. We remade all the graphics, including map tiles and character sprites, and worked hard to enhance the atmosphere and 2D beauty in The Witch's House. It took us five times as many hours to create this version, but we feel like we've finally managed to satisfy ourselves. Aside from graphical improvements, we also added two new difficulty settings that was not present in the free version. The first difficulty setting is a more accessible one that allows you to instantly retry. The other difficulty setting is a more difficult one which is only unlocked by those who manage to reach the game's true ending.  The normal difficulty isn't enough to satisfy me. . .   I'm not averse to instantly dying upon reaching new areas.  If either of these describe you, then we recommend you give this new difficulty a try. You also may be able to uncover some new story bits concerning  her . . . The world of The Witch's House has been reborn anew, and we sincerely hope you'll all enjoy it.

She is particularly fond of a beautiful piece of work called Ruka on display deep within the gallery, and she often makes the trek simply to see it. And then one day, Mina’s whole world changes. She finds herself with the ability to see the inhuman entities hidden in the crowds. Ruka is not merely a doll, but a being known as an Eidos with the power to shape the future.

Mina naturally resists, as she simply wants to be a normal high-school girl, but the world is not so kind, and she’s unable to escape from the Puppets.

The Noble and Reformist Factions have been none too kind to one another over the years, and tensions between the two only stand to worsen if compromises aren’t made in the very near future.  Rean Schwarzer, like any other citizen of the Imperial Nation, is no stranger to these rising conflicts: the class system has been deeply embedded into the hearts of every Erebonian since the days of old. As a seventeen-year-old student preparing for his new life at Thors Military Academy, however, he notices that his crimson uniform differs from the standard ones issued to his peers—typically green for commoners, and white for nobles. Enter, Class VII of Thors Military Academy. For the first time in the prestigious academy’s history, rank means nothing and skill means everything.

Although the positive impact of this revolution is obvious, every coin has a flipside; for every beneficial device developed with these new materials, so too were advanced weapons and other implements of war. Thus, the land became mired with turmoil, and remains in such a state even now. Enter, the bracers: an organization established to serve as police and intermediaries alike, holding above all else the peace and safety of the lands under their jurisdiction. Whenever a citizen is in need of assistance, he or she may place a request at the local Bracer Guild -- and be it monster extermination, crime prevention or even peace talks among warring nations, the bracers will do whatever they can to resolve the matter cleanly and efficiently. Some matters require a gentler touch than others, however. When an orbalship transporting a legendary  S-rank  bracer named Cassius Bright suddenly goes missing, said bracer's daughter, Estelle, and adoptive son, Joshua, must join forces in search of him across the entire Kingdom of Liberl. And what they find along the way could change both of their lives forever. . .

Introducing people, places, ideas, events and lore that rival in complexity those of even the most highly-regarded fantasy epics in literature, the care and attention given to each and every NPC, location and historical in-game event is what sets The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky apart from its contemporaries. Come join Estelle, Joshua, Scherazard, Olivier and the rest of the cast as they uncover the secret underbelly of Liberl in their first 50+ hour masterpiece, and see what Japanese gamers have been raving about for over ten years.

The main character, who is the student president of the high school, has another hidden persona. The persona as head of the “Gang Rape Club”. . . A dark ceremony existed that had been handed down for thousands of years in the old town of Rinin; the name of the ceremony, in particular, in the oldest of records. That ceremony, enacted to protect the region from disease and crop failure as a curse from the region's guardian deity, Hime Iwanaga, occurs in the evenings between the new moon and full moon, in which a maiden is disguised as Konohanasakuyabime and gangraped to appease Hime Iwanaga's anger. In regards to the maiden, there must be an important man participating in the gang rape, in other words, that man must be related in blood to their wife or lover, mother or daughter, younger sister or older sister, and the like, and after the gang rape, if a pregnancy occurs, Hime Iwanaga's anger is abated, and a good harvest and safety upon the region will be promised. However, if a pregnancy does not occur for the sake of suppressing Hime Iwanaga's anger, the maiden is supposed to be covered with semen, and floated down the river alive, as a sacrifice. And now---After the Tashio era, the ceremony itself had vanished into the dark history, but had still continued on at Rinin High School; the cruel, improper traditions being inherited over into a secret society through actions carried out by the Gang Rape Club. For generations, the student president of the High School has served as the head of the Gang Rape Club, not allowing even one day to pass uneventfully, submerging numerous women to the dark, suffocating pleasure. &lt;/span&gt;Title: The Gang Rape ClubOriginal title: 輪姦倶楽部Year: Japan 2008-03-21, English Patch 2008-08-10Length: Medium (10 - 30 hours)Language: EnglishVoice: Japanese18+ SCREENSHOTS~(˘▾˘~)  DOWNLOAD  (~˘▾˘)~Google Drive - Mega. nzSYSTEM REQUIREMENTSMINIMUM: - OS: Windows 7 or later&lt;/div&gt;"

It's important to note here that the game takes place around 2050 in Tokyo, so technology has become relatively advanced. The world itself seems to be VERY grim. It's also slightly fantasy based as it seems many different races inhabit the world, including vampires, orcs, and various types of evil spirits, which are the demons or  evil influenced  people that are making the world so corrupt.

It was an enormous box-shaped island built by the government and referred to as “Tokyo Kingdom”. There was hope that it would become a second city center floating at sea, but it had failed to attract businesses. The only way of getting to and from the island was through Honshu Island over the 10 kilometer Tokyo Kingdom bridge. Unfortunately, this narrow route was the means in which the inhabitants of hell found their way onto the island, luring anarchists, criminals, and even illegal immigrants there, transforming the streets of the sea bound city into a world-renowned haven for danger. However abandoned the streets were, order did exist in such a place despite it being a breeding place of crime. There was a business district at the heart as well as one of Asia's greatest prostitute grottoes. Whether or not it was only the strong who survived, the viability of living there required one not to be careless in making friends with the strong.

Upon quickly contacting the employer and learning that the position had yet to be filled, he applied without delay. The job was as a live-in servant at a mansion. His first day of work arrived. Upon arrival at the mansion deep in the mountains he was surprised by the size of the grounds and the palatial building itself… appropriate for the richest of the rich. The mansion’s beautiful mistress and her equally beautiful daughters came out to meet him. However, within that day his expectations turned to bewilderment and then despair. By the time he learned the reason behind the high wages he was being offered for a simple handyman’s job, it was too late… The work that awaited him was that of a “handyman” in name only. He joined several other servants at the beck and call of the mansion’s mistress, tasked with pleasing every perverted whim of her odd family. Servants both male and female were unable to escape the mansion, forced to continually take part the unending bizarre play of the family’s mad escapades.

Freed from the shackles of employment, man could pursue more earthly endeavors. However, listlessness and disobedience rampaged throughout the middle and working classes.

SENRAN KAGURA SHINOVI VERSUS immediately follows the events of SENRAN KAGURA Burst, revisiting the fierce rivalry between the girls of Hanzō National Academy and their sworn enemies from Hebijo Clandestine Girls’ Academy, the latter of which have now gone underground and formed a mercenary strike team known as the Homura Crimson Squad. In addition to their old adversaries, the Hanzō girls must also face a whole new set of foes: the students of Gessen Girls’ Academy, who seek to punish them for their imperfections as shinobi warriors. Meanwhile, a new class is in session at Hebijo, and these students mean business: they oppose all three of the competing factions and will stop at nothing to be the last shinobi squad standing – even if it means leaving broken bodies and shattered dreams in their wake. The stage is set for a shinobi battle royale. Heroines and renegades battle saints and sinners in a flurry of fists, feet, clothes, tattered remnants of those clothes, and sometimes underclothes.

Few shinobi have ever been able to prepare a dish so exquisite, but legendary shinobi and sushi chef Hanzo thinks that perhaps his students and their rivals are up to the task. He holds a contest to see which of the girls can hone her Ninja Arts best for cooking as opposed to combat. The competition is fierce; the one who presents the old shinobi master with the Super Dish will obtain a Secret Ninja Art Scroll that will make real her most fervent desire. Whosoever can prove her knife to be as suitable for cooking as for combat will emerge the victor, while all her friends and rivals wind up as mere dessert. . .

As I listened to her talk, my memories drifted back to the days we were still together. Back when we were in school, she asked me what was necessary for the two of us to be together. A small workplace that we could make a living from without relying on anyone. A silent apartment where we would have the freedom to do what our hearts desired. I told her that. In the late eighties – during the economic boom – the small design company we founded was doing surprisingly well. We visited all the places we talked about when we were in school – the southern islands, the old European cities, the West Coast. We went wherever we wanted, seeing whatever we sought. Alone in that spacious living room, I attempted to figure out why it all ended this way. Why those days when nothing could stand in our way faded into the past. I no longer felt like I could do everything. The world had grown complicated. Even simple matters became difficult. The rules we had established in the past no longer seemed to apply, and the castle we built for ourselves crumbled to dust.  What is necessary for us to be together?  – the ghost asked me. We need a make a new place for ourselves. A place no one can destroy. Let's make it a place that no one else can reach. And so, I inconspicuously proceeded with the plan. In a place so deep below the surface that no one else can find it. SCREENSHOTS~(˘▾˘~)  DOWNLOAD  (~˘▾˘)~Google Drive - Mega. nzSYSTEM REQUIREMENTSMINIMUM: - OS: Windows 7 or later&lt;/div&gt;"

In real life, however, Kotone is an average woman who works an average job, with a below average relationship with her estranged parents. Every day that passes is the same, and Kotone soon grows tired of her monotonous routine. If only she could enter a world like Asaph, filled with fantastical creatures and frightening monsters… but Asaph Online is only a game. There’s no way a game could ever become a reality. At least, that’s what Kotone used to think – until a mysterious force summons her to the world she has traversed so many times through her computer screen. Now, Kotone isn’t just Kotone, but the dark witch Viola – and, freed from her societal obligations, she finally decides to have some fun!Viola is the name Kotone gave to her character in Asaph Online. Upon awakening in Asaph, Kotone inherits Viola’s appearance, her magical powers, and her name. Viola is a dark witch with unimaginable powers, who is feared by everybody in Asaph. Many have tried to challenge her, but none have emerged victorious. She enjoys grinding people down beneath her heel (sometimes literally), and treats those around her as little more than playthings. She’s a deeply sadistic, dangerous woman… but even she has a soft side. Neve is Viola’s trusted most trusted maid, who would do anything to help her mistress. Neve is a member of the darkling race, which is reviled throughout Asaph as being savage and hostile, but Neve eschews these unfair perceptions. She is a diligent, loyal, industrious girl – but she may be a touch too devoted. She adores Viola, and becomes irrationally angry at any perceived slights against her beloved mistress. Self-sacrificing and hard-working though she is, Neve can be rather scary when she wants. If she were to fight seriously, she may even be able to defeat demons. Fion is a young, put-upon lass from a huge family, who works hard to ensure all her brothers and sisters have enough food to eat…At least, that’s what she says, but Neve isn’t entirely convinced.

Business is as usual in the isolated research city of Rokumei–that is until several explosions suddenly go off in the nuclear research facility known as “LABO. ” The city sends in “Sirius,” an elite rescue squad, to deal with the situation. But the situation only gets worse when LABO’s nuclear reactor melts down, sending the facility into lockdown–with members of Sirius and survivors still trapped inside. With lethal radiation leaking everywhere and not enough anti-radiation medication to last until lockdown lifts, the survivors make more and more grim discoveries. In their struggle for survival, in a deathtrap full of fire and radiation, they learn that doubt is their greatest enemy, and trust their greatest asset. The story of Root Double features two different protagonists: Watase Kasasagi, a rescue squad captain who has lost his memories in the hours after the incident, and Natsuhiko Tenkawa, a student piecing together the clues in the six days before. The only key to survival lies in the player’s hands with the Senses Sympathy System (SSS). Unlike traditional visual novels, Root Double does not have clear cut “choices,” but rather, the game uses SSS to allow the player to manipulate the story based purely upon emotion. Your emotions projected upon the characters, particularly your trust in them, shape the progression of the story. Only with effective use of this system and completion of both protagonists’ stories can the player piece together the truth and hope to discover a way out of the facility.

Three ‘witches of disaster’ appeared and invaded a territory of the demon country of Saarland.

This 2D sidescrolling exploration platformer follows the adventure of Erina, whose humdrum life as a regular rabbit is turned upside-down when she finds herself in an unknown world and turned into a human (with rabbit ears)!Along the way she meets the cheerful pink-haired fairy, Ribbon, who mysteriously chooses to stay by Erina’s side. These unwitting heroes embark together on their quest to restore Erina’s life to normalcy, but who knows what troubles lurk, waiting for them…: Rabi-Ribi is a 2D exploration platformer that focuses on non-linear gameplay. There will be hints to guide the player along, but they’re never required to follow them, which allows for much greater freedom to—you guessed it—explore. Players will play as our protagonist Erina, who focuses on close quarters combat. Ribbon the fairy is the ranged attacker who follows Erina’s lead, indirectly controlled by the player. Erina may be a little rabbit that was turned into a human, but that doesn’t stop her from being capable of some pretty neat moves. Both Erina and Ribbon’s abilities can be improved by learning new skills and attacks through collecting items and upgrades that are spread throughout the world. What trinkets and skills to pick up is up to the player; dare you challenge hard mode without any items?: – Retro exploration platformer featuring a bunny girl. – 4+n difficulty settings for all types of players. – 9+ main areas and 20+ sub-areas to explore. – Bunny. – Over 60 items and upgrades. – Over 20 fully illustrated characters with cutscene illustrations. – 40+ boss battles, 1000+ attack patterns with Boss Rush Mode to fight some or all of them in a row. – Post game story and content with speedrun mode which takes out every section of the game where the player cannot control the main character. – Over 50+ pieces from an original soundtrack. – English, Chinese and Japanese support. – Bunny.

Protagonist Syuji Asanaga and his childhood friend Yotsuko Utakane, while tracking down Syuji's missing grandfather, unexpectedly ended up traveling through time to the 17th century, a time known for exciting advances in scientific discovery. What they witnessed upon their arrival was the presence of a single girl right in front of them. This particular girl would go on to be dubbed as the father of modern-day science, Sir Isaac Newton!That’s correct, Newton turned out to be a small, flat-chested girl!Unaware of this, Syuji loudly crashed into the apple tree right in front of the girl.  You do realize that I was just on the verge of making the most groundbreaking discovery, don't you!? It was at the moment our main couple traveled through time,right then and there, that Newton discovered universal gravitation!And just like that, through Syuji's witless conduct, the great scientific discoveries of that century had all crumbled to ashes. What's more, like the domino effect, this would gradually end up altering key points in history.  Now taking up residence at the prestigious English university called  Tenbridge University,  Syuji finds himself pulled into the antics of four strange girls (and Yotsuko). In the midst of all this chaos, will Syuji ever be able to rectify history and return to the present!?Syuji Asanaga: Role: Stuck in the Middle(Including heroines from the waist down)A teenager that hates science. Our protagonist. Also a virgin. His grandfather was the second Japanese physicist to be awarded a Nobel Prize. Syuji and his childhood friend, Yotsuko, have been mentored by him ever since they were young. A science-loving boy, but the constant comparisons to his grandfather made him grow sick of it. One day, his grandfather went on a trip to England, only to end up going missing. Syuji was in so much shock that he started writing music to escape reality. And so he lived as a miserable virgin, until he was reunited with Yotsuko and they somehow ended up being flung through time. Syuji now finds himself surrounded by four strange girls (and Yotsuko), and to make matters worse, he's the only one with a lick of common sense!Make your way into the heart of a heroine, change the future, and find your grandfather!Alice Bedford: Role: Conceited AirheadAn extremely bright girl who enrolled at Tenbridge University after skipping grades. Because it was prohibited by law for women to write theses, she used the pen name  Isaac Newton.   That's why she went down in history as a man. With her exceptional abilities, on top of her excessive pride and greed, she is almost untouchable on the campus. She has a bad habit of adding notes to the books inside the library without permission. Barely a book has escaped her scientific scribbles!Yotsuko Utakane: Role: Sharp-tongued AirheadYotsuko is a girl who loves to measure everything around her, and she won't be satisfied unless she's measured down to the tiniest detail!She's Syuji's childhood friend. His grandfather taught her how fun science could be, and she's been devoted to the field ever since. She has a daily routine of measuring her own body in millimeters and adding it to her records every morning. Ask her about her figure and she'll give her most up-to-date measurements without a second thought!She's very good with numbers, but between you and me, she's kinda clumsy. Haru Tsukumo: Role: Natural AirheadHaru is an exchange student from Japan, studying astronomy in 17th century England. Her grandfather was the one to originally move abroad, but Japan closed its borders and isolated itself from the world soon after. Because of this, Haru was born in England, unable to see the Japan she yearns for. She is the only person who truly understands Alice, and they support each other while spending their days together in Tenbridge. Lavi Gier: Role: Deranged AirheadA problematic girl who's constantly causing fires all around Tenbridge University. Unlike Alice's theoretical and factual approach to science, she's a genius scientist who lets intuition guide her hand. She lives in an age where modern science, magic, and alchemy coexist. If her intuition is telling her  yes,  then you bet she's gonna do it!She was the first to figure out that Syuji wasn't from her time, igniting her curiosity. What she wants the most right now is a male test subject that listens to everything she says. Emmy Felton: Role: Potato AirheadEmmy works as a maid at Tenbridge University to support her younger brothers. Her work takes her all over campus, so if you ever want to know anything about the place, she's the girl to ask!She resides in the same dorm as Alice and Haru, handling all of the household chores such as laundry, cleaning duty, and cooking meals, while also looking after all of the residents. She takes her job very seriously, never removing her headband while she's at work. This means your only chance to see her with her hair down is when she's off the clock!Though you'd need to be a lucky guy to see that. She works every day, leaving her with only enough time to spend with those truly close to her. That's exactly why her headband is so valuable to her. 	Woo the hearts of 5 potential ladies, all of whom have their own quirks and. . .  airheadded-ness?  	Discover multiple endings as Syuji attempts to return history to its natural state 	An exciting visual novel featuring an all-star Japanese voice castTitle: Newton to Ringo no KiOriginal title: ニュートンと林檎の樹Year: Japan 2017-03-26, English 2018-08-14Length: Medium (10 - 30 hours)Language: EnglishVoice: Japanese18+SCREENSHOTS~(˘▾˘~)  DOWNLOAD  (~˘▾˘)~Google DriveSYSTEM REQUIREMENTSMINIMUM: - OS: Windows 7 or later"

His life takes an unexpected turn when he finds a girl (Meiya) he doesn't remember ever meeting in his bed one morning. Whom later revealed to be the heiress of one of the biggest zaibatsu.

    "body": "2019/05/30 - TRAILERABOUT THIS GAMEMuv-Luv Alternative is a direct sequel to Muv-Luv Unlimited, and is the grand finale of the Muv-Luv trilogy. This page contains spoilers to the first game, so if this is your first time hearing about Muv-Luv series, we recommend playing Muv-Luv first. About Muv-Luv Alternative:: This is it. The chips are down, the die’s been cast, and the fate of the multiverse is on the line. Step back into the cockpit and prepare for deployment in Muv-Luv Alternative, the most critically acclaimed visual novel of all time. Just be sure to keep a box of tissues handy, because it’s about to be a bumpy ride. This isn’t a cutesy high school rom-com anymore; it’s an epic tale of political conspiracies, international espionage, an alien menace, quantum causality, bittersweet reunions, genetic modification, and much, much more. Gluttons for punishment, rejoice, because once it gets rolling, there are no brakes on this pain train. It’ll test your limits, challenge your worldview, and by the time it’s all over, you’ll be so emotionally spent that it’ll be weeks before you can fully process the implications of what you’ve just witnessed. Fair warning, though: common side effects include feelings of emptiness, PTSD, and unrealistic expectations for any and all other visual novels. This definitive release comes complete with a brand new translation, all-new CGs, additional voice acting, and dual language/ tablet support, so if you think you’re ready to take the dive, there’s never been a better time to strap in and see for yourself why so many readers consider this the greatest story ever told. The Story So Far: (PLEASE NOTE: The following section contains major spoilers for the previous installment in the franchise. Muv-Luv Alternative picks up where the events of the original Muv-Luv left off, and certain scenes will play out differently depending on your choices in the first game. To get the most out of the Muv-Luv experience, we highly recommend that you complete the original game before starting Muv-Luv Alternative. Click here to jump to the game’s product page on Steam. )Three years have passed since the day Takeru, an unsuspecting Japanese high-schooler, suddenly awoke in a world not his own — a war-torn alternate reality in which mankind was on the brink of extinction, locked in a decades-long struggle against the ruthless extra-terrestrial invaders known only as the BETA. In that time, he’s been through an awful lot — enlisting in the military, meeting parallel-universe versions of his old friends, and even falling in love. But unbeknownst to Takeru, he and his squadmates were being trained to participate in a top-secret UN contingency plan known as Alternative IV — a last-ditch effort to take back the Earth via experimental technology. Unfortunately, however, development screeched to a halt when the project’s chief executive, Professor Kouzuki, hit a wall in her research due to technological constraints. With tensions rising, and pressure to shift gears from governments all across the world, the UN delegation opted to scrap the project in favor of its successor: Alternative V. This was humanity’s last resort — a plan that utilized all of their remaining resources to build a migrant fleet of interstellar craft, allowing a tiny fraction of the population to abandon the Earth in the hopes of finding life anew in another star system. Takeru and his comrades-in-arms were among those left behind, condemned to death by their fellow man. But it seems the hand of fate has bigger plans for Takeru, because it’s at this point that he wakes up to find himself back in his childhood bedroom once again. Not in his own world, mind you — but back where he was first spat out into this hellscape three years prior. This was no dream; this was a recurring nightmare. But then it hits him: this is a second chance. If he’s truly been sent back in time, then he’s the only one who knows of the impending doom that awaits this world. Perhaps he can use this knowledge to warn Professor Kouzuki, and together, they can somehow find a way to prevent Alternative V from ever being enacted. And who knows? If he can change history, then maybe — just maybe — he’ll find the answers to all of his questions. Why has he gone back in time? Why isn’t Sumika here? And most importantly, what IS Alternative IV?Features:: Linear Visual Novel - Unlike the first two parts, Muv-Luv Alternative is almost designed as a straightforward interactive premiere movie, complete with voice acting, subtitles, and intense music, perfectly fitting for a finale. Over 50-70 hours reading time. Available in three languages - Japanese, English and Simplified Chinese. The UI has been reworked, so it's compatible with the newest tablet PCs and touchscreens. User save data are stored in Steam cloud so readers can continue their progress anywhere with ease.

Although half of the town's citizens support the building of such a mill, the other half fear the potential for pollution and contamination of their beloved river. Recognizing Ohitoyo's budgetary decline over the last few decades, Sotetsu believes that the town requires a system that allows it to be fiscally independent instead of reliant upon a factory to stimulate its economy, and sets out to identify an alternative method in achieving this goal. It's during this time that Sotetsu comes across an android-like being--a  Raillord  named Hachiroku--while looking through his late adoptive father's belongings. Although inanimate, Hachiroku and Sotetsu forge a deep, unlikely connection, and from this bond, work together in hopes of restoring Ohitoyo to its former glory.

Humans were unable to repel them until after a few years, some people gained special abilities known as ‘douryoku’ which allowed them to exterminate the Kotona and return peace to the world. Now, Seiichi attends the super-elite Kashinomori Academy which trains people with douryoku in preparation for another attack by the Kotona. However, even though he has great power, he doesn’t have the ability to manifest it, leading to him being labelled as ‘most useless one’. The rest of the students in his class all had great skill, but in particular one girl caught his attention. Akane had average powers even though she came from a distinguished family, so she trained hard daily to improve her skills.

This was the territory of the demi-humans who have resided here peacefully for thousands of years. One time, the ‘Kami no Kaido’, the ruler of the southeastern plains who is close to God, declared that he would train a successor to inherit his immense power and knowledge. With those words, he opened the gates to the holy land, ‘Shrine of the End’ (Tsui no Goshi). The successor candidates were bestowed the privilege to explore the previously-sealed area and various abilities by the Kami no Kaido, to overcome the severe trials that lay before them. Youths from all races and religions heeded this call and gathered together, including the young researcher Erballade who left his hometown to seek wisdom and the unknown. There will only be one successor. With honour, wisdom, power and wealth, along with the expectations of their hometowns, a fierce competition is about to begin.

Through use of the game's flowchart system, players navigate through the story and uncover clues to unravel the mysteries of Urashima, the titular island. The story of ISLAND revolves around Sanzenkai Setsuna, a young man who wakes up on the shore of Urashima with no memories of his past. During the game, you'll explore Setsuna's relationship with three girls on the island, Rinne, Karen, and Sara. As he uncovers the hidden secrets of Urashima's past - and future - Setsuna must fight against fate to protect that which he treasures most. Will you be able to discover the truth and save Urashima, or find yourself lost among the ISLAND's many dead ends?World and BackgroundUrashima is a small island, far from mainland Japan. It's a true utopia, blessed with rich natural beauty. But the island harbors a difficult past, and it's about to be erased, silently, from history. Soot blight syndrome, an endemic disease, has brought about a rift between the island and the mainland. An offshore platform intended for marine research has long been left abandoned; five years ago, three separate incidents brought the once influential Three Families of Urashima to near ruin. Rumors about children being spirited away have become part of the local folklore, alongside another legend, one that has been repeated on the island since time immemorial. . .  Let me tell you the legend of this island: it's a story of tragic love. . .  The key to saving the island lies with three girls, each of whom belongs to one of the Three Families. These girls aren't able to change the fate of the island by themselves, but might they succeed with the help of the young man who's just washed ashore? Claiming that he's traveled back in time, the man immediately sets out on a lonely path, challenging the longstanding traditions of the island, and seeking to change the future. But those aren't his only goals. . . How will his presence transform the lives of these three girls, the future of the island, and the fate of the world. . . ?Title: ISLANDOriginal title: アイランドYear: Japan 2016-03-12, English 2018-08-24Length: Long (30 - 50 hours)Language: EnglishVoice: JapaneseAll agesSCREENSHOTS~(˘▾˘~)  DOWNLOAD  (~˘▾˘)~Google Drive - Mega. nzSYSTEM REQUIREMENTSMINIMUM:OS: Windows 7 or laterProcessor: Intel Core 2 DUOMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: VRAM320MB, 1280×720DirectX: Version 9. 0cStorage: 4 GB available spaceSound Card: Support for PCM playback through DirectSoundAdditional Notes: Windows Media Player 9 equivalent or higher"

The contaminated atmosphere is turning ash gray, life on Earth almost came to a stop and water started vanishing. The world population has declined remarkably compared to the Golden Age. The people joined together to live in this world. It was in these times that a  Phiroid , a robot that can feel, woke up in a decayed facility. The fruit of science before the war: a humanoid, feeling robot. They were promised a new partner, one that could make their life easier. However, the awakened Phiroid finds out very quickly that he is emotionless. Perhaps he was not finished during the manufacturing process since his right hand is not covered with artificial skin, his mechanical parts visible. The Phiroid wanted to get closer to humans. He continued to wander through this devastated world, looking for the emotions he was missing. One day, a girl takes him in. She thinks of him as human and kindly looks after him. A little but warm town. The Phiroid boy began learning what feelings are while living together with this girl.

Together they make up an agency called SORD (Social Ops, Research &amp; Development). The specialist training school now entrusts the misfit girls who attend it with guns and live ammunition in the name of national defense. Paying their own safety no heed, these students are again and again plunged into dangerous extrajudicial missions - all for the good of the realm.  We've been granted a place in the world. That alone isn't enough - there wouldn't be any meaning in living, if that was all we had. . . It's not enough just to get by on the backs of others. I live by my own strength, and I fight to survive. Because only the survivors among us belong with the living. . .  No matter how much life grinds them down, what future awaits these girls, who've themselves chosen the path of the gun?Title: Grisaia: Phantom Trigger Vol. 1Original title: グリザイア：ファントムトリガー Vol. 1Year: Japan 2017-04-28, English Patch 2017-04-28Length: Short (2 - 10 hours)Language: EnglishVoice: JapaneseAll agesSCREENSHOTS~(˘▾˘~)  DOWNLOAD  (~˘▾˘)~Google Drive - Mega. nzSYSTEM REQUIREMENTSMINIMUM:OS: 7/8. 1/10Processor: Intel Core 2 DUOMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: VRAM320MB, 1280×720DirectX: Version 9. 0cStorage: 2 GB available spaceSound Card: Support for PCM playback through DirectSoundAdditional Notes: Windows Media Player 9 equivalent or higher"

While working at her part-time job, Minamo spies Ryo and his girlfriend Mio as they eat together, their love for each other clearly visible in their eyes. She wishes she could sit like that with Satoru, but she knows she's too shy to ever come out and confess her feelings to him. Soon after, Minamo is killed in an accident. Filled with remorse at not seizing her chance for love while she was alive, she visits Ryo and asks for his help. If he'll lend her his own life force, she'll be able to tell her feelings to Satoru. Ryo doesn't know until it's too late that lending Minamo his life energy will turn him into a lifeless spirit!And so the wheels of fate turn, winding the destinies of everyone together: dead Minamo and her reluctant helper Ryo; the pure Mio and her carefree twin sister Mao; the competitive Kokoro, who won't give up Satoru without a fight; the lonely spirit Izumi; and the perplexing Soul Collector.

While he really likes eroge, he can't draw, isn't much of a writer or composer, and doesn't know much about business. Still, his dream is to get a job at an eroge studio in hopes of creating what he loves, eroge. Tomoya's luck takes a turn for the better when he sees a help wanted ad for the local studio Flower, and after a meeting with the company president (who to his surprise looks like an elementary school kid), manages to get a job as administrator of the company's website. Tomoya's glee at being part of the eroge industry is short-lived, as he soon learns that Flower is on the chopping block due to their first title being a massive failure. After playing through Flower's first title, Tomoya realizes that his co-workers don't know anything about eroge, lacking the insight and understanding needed to make a good game.

He survives by eating only cheap food in a tiny apartment. When a ship that he's on to visit his parents sinks, he's unable to get to the lifeboats in time. Just before he runs out of air, he sees a light and finds himself in a strange world ruled by monster girls. In this world he encounters three of them, one after the other. Each of them want him to be their husband because there are only females of their species, so monster girls only have humans to choose from if they desire children. Due to how their world works, there is a very short time limit on Morgan's choice. The three girls decide to have one day with him each and one shared day with all of them. Afterwards, he will decide who he likes best. CharactersMorganHe is the character you play as. He's confused about the world he finds himself in and is initially more than a little bit afraid of the monster girls who take an interest in him. Beatrice (Lamia)A tall woman with the lower body of a snake. She has a short temper and is very prideful due to her rich upbringing. Her claws are extremely sharp which she uses to hunt wild animals for fun. She thinks of Morgan as being very stupid upon meeting him. Reina (Kraken)She's a monster girl who has tried repeatedly to get a human to like her, but has failed each time because of how creepily possessive she is. Being part squid, she's an excellent swimmer, but she has trouble moving around on land. She adores Morgan as soon as they meet, but he's wary of her behaviour. Iris (Alraune)Shy and kind, Iris is from a species that often win humans over due to their cuteness. She's a living plant who feeds on water, sunlight and fruits/vegetables. Looking the most humanoid overall and being smaller than the others make her the easiest for Morgan to talk to at first.

To them, suffering defeat in the war meant nothing. If anything, the countless lives lost in the battle served as a catalyst to their sacrificial ceremony. Whether or not their attempt bore fruit ― not a soul knows. Following the war, they faded from sight, mind, and eventually into the realm of myth. 61 years later ― Japan, 2006. Ren Fujii, a young man attending high school in Suwahara City, finds his friendship with his old buddy Shirou Yusa shatter to pieces following a certain incident, ending in a vicious fight that sees Ren hospitalized for two months. The season shifts from autumn to winter ― to the dawning weeks of December, with Christmas on the horizon. Having lost his best friend, Ren leaves the hospital with the intention to rebuild his new life without Shirou. But even that plan soon falls apart. Irrationality that defies the realm of common sense begins to assault and devour the city. Abnormalities soon seek to destroy everything Ren holds dear before his eyes with overwhelming violence. He must change, even if it means crossing the boundary between the ordinary and the extraordinary. His desires are hardly anything grand. All he wants is to return to those days of old. Back to those days filled with simple, everyday joy. The battle with the Longinus Dreizehn Orden. A continuation of that war full of madness, carnage, and maledictions. What future awaits Ren at the end of his road. . . ?Title: Dies iraeOriginal title: ディエス・イレYear: Japan 2007-12-21, English 2017-12-19Length: Very long (&gt; 50 hours)Language: EnglishVoice: Japanese18+ SCREENSHOTS~(˘▾˘~)  DOWNLOAD  (~˘▾˘)~Google Drive - Mega. nzSYSTEM REQUIREMENTSMINIMUM: - OS: Windows XP or later"

In the span of two generations the town was built up to the status of prestige it now commands, an expansion helmed by the Hadou Group, an industrial complex and family dynasty currently run by the young Hadou Ruri. She pursues the peace and prosperity of Arkham diligently, against the forces of darkness threatening to plunge the city, and the world, back into a second dark age. Among the most sinister threats to Arkham City is the evil Black Lodge syndicate. Led by the charismatic Master Therion, his nihilistic outlook shapes the group's destructive goals: with a circle of powerful sorcerers at his command, the potential for sowing chaos in the city is unmatched. Former Miskatonic University Magic Academy student Daijuuji Kurou knows little of grimoires, but what he does know terrifies him - enough that he left his university life behind, and now practices a failing detective business in the shelter of an orphanage in a quiet corner of Arkham. But just when he thought his Academy past was buried, it catches up with him and pulls him back into the dark shadows of the occult: Hadou Ruri herself appears at his door with an offer he can't refuse. The only way to combat the Black Lodge's growing magical power is to find, and retrieve, a grimoire with the power to activate the mightiest Machina of all: Demonbane. The quest to find this forbidden tome will change Kurou's destiny. . . forever.

Because you see, today is her birthday! She’ll be turning…7 again, naturally.

If you have not played it, then I beg thee delve farther into these depths at your own risk, dear player!An anthology series that serves as a Corpse Party sequel, prequel, midquel, and alternate universe tale all in one, Corpse Party: Book of Shadows is a horror/adventure game developed by MAGES. (formerly 5pb. Games) and published under the supervision of the original series creators at Team GrisGris.  Corpse Party: Book of Shadows builds upon the events of the first game, exploring or re-exploring past incidents, characters, and points of view, and allowing the player to escape many of the deaths that occurred previously, thus steering them toward all-new (albeit not necessarily better) outcomes. This PC version updates the original PSP system version’s art to HD and adds full mouse support for authentic point-and-click gameplay, providing the definitive Corpse Party: Book of Shadows experience for series fans who are eager to delve a little deeper into its storied lore. Before, during, and after the events of Corpse Party—in the canon universe, as well as in several alternate timelines—the students of Kisaragi Academy, Byakudan Senior High, Paulownia High, and Musashigawa Middle School had far more experiences within the cursed halls of Heavenly Host Elementary than the stories typically recount. How would events have unfolded, for example, in a universe where each student went into the Sachiko Ever After ritual with an unconscious awareness of everything that was going to happen to them? What might’ve occurred to Mayu if she’d never interacted with the ghostly children in the school infirmary? What might’ve occurred to Yuka if she’d been caught during the harrowing chase in the second wing? What might’ve occurred to Seiko if Naomi had gotten to the bathroom just a bit earlier?On the other side of the coin, how did Naho actually get into Heavenly Host, and whom did she come with? What was Tohko’s relationship with Kizami, and how did that result in a lost tooth? And what connection did Ms. Yui have to the cursed elementary school prior to ever taking part in the Sachiko Ever After ritual?Most crucially, what happened to the survivors of the previous incident after their escape? How did the loss of their friends affect them? And what does all of this have to do with the mysterious tome known as the “Book of Shadows”…?FEATURES: Point-and-Click-Style First-Person GameplayMore realistically proportioned and immersive first-person environments bring Heavenly Host to life in all its grim glory, with point-and-click-style “Search Mode” allowing players to scour every inch of every room via keyboard, gamepad, mouse, or any combination thereof…Original Japanese Voiceovers with More 3D Audio Than Ever BeforeEvery line of dialogue is spoken in its original Japanese by a who’s who of Japanese voiceover talent, with many crucial scenes recorded in binaural 3D using dummy-head microphones: play with quality headphones or a hi-fi stereo setup to hear the horror coming from all around you, or perhaps from right next to your ear…Dastardly “Darkening” System Leads to Painful DemiseCharacters gradually become frightened and unstable as horrific discoveries are made, distorting the game’s graphics and altering their decision-making abilities; continuing down these darkened paths will result in one of the game’s many dozens of gruesome “Wrong Ends,” all of which are virtually guaranteed to replay in players’ nightmares…Enhanced Focus on Side CharactersThe already robust cast from the original game is further humanized, with a focus on those characters whose screen time may have been lacking before; learn more about your favorite side characters, and find out just what was going on in their heads (before those heads were crushed)…Unlockables, Achievements, and MoreSteam achievements, collectibles, voice cast interviews, music tracks, art stills, and more are unlockable through a variety of means for attentive and detail-oriented players; additionally, those who’ve conquered or even just dabbled in the first Corpse Party will be able to import their save-data to unlock dozens more art stills, and possibly even make the crucial final chapter of the story available to play through a bit sooner than it otherwise would be…SCREENSHOTS~(˘▾˘~)  DOWNLOAD  (~˘▾˘)~Google Drive - Mega. nzSYSTEM REQUIREMENTSMINIMUM:OS: Windows 7 or later"

And a childhood promise—Yuuto was raised in an orphanage in England. He was taken to Japan after being adopted by Takakura Yoshiomi, an executive of his business. Yuuto, who couldn’t speak Japanese, was supported by his twin sister-in-laws, the bright and shy Anzu, and the cool and reliable Anri, along with the innocent and gentle Tsubame, and the showy and devious Izumi. The young boys and girls were unaware of love. They laughed and they cried, nurturing irreplaceable bonds.

However, in this timeline, all the Samurai are inexplicably female. You can get to know the “intimate” side of the characters from the classic Japanese tale of the 47 Ronin while playing a visual novel ー all without any of the dangly or rough bits of the original!This visual novel has been adapted from a sound novel based on the actual historical facts of the Ako incident. In adapting the story to visual novel format, most of the main characters of the 47 Ronin have been turned into females, and parts of the core story have been polished into a lighter literary style that also incorporates fantasy elements. The story goes something like this…On the 14th day of the third month of Genroku 14 (1701 CE), an incident occurred involving the ruler of the Ako Domain, Lord Asano Takumi No Mikami shedding the blood of Kira Kousuke No Suke in the Corridor of the Pines in Edo Palace. This incident that would later become known in Japan as the famous Ako incident. Upon hearing of this incident on the same day, the fifth shogun of the Tokugawa dynasty, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, became enraged. It was ruled that that very same day, Lord Asano should be sentenced to seppuku, after which his lands were to be scattered and his house broken up. Meanwhile, Kira Kousuke No Suke received no no rebuke whatsoever, going against the tradition set by the first Shogun of punishing both parties in a fight. Unable to comprehend this harsh and shocking punishment, the loyal Samurai retainers of Ako start to move to restore honour to their master by commencing a vendetta against Lord Kira. Meanwhile, Fukami Suguha is transported from present day Japan to the Edo-period Ako domain, where he gets to know the Ako Ronin. What will become of Suguha as he throws himself to the mercy of the cogs of history, and will he ever be able to return to his own time?Title: ChuSinGura 46+1Original title: 忠臣蔵46+1, ChuShinGura 46+1Year: Japan 2013-03-14, English 2016-09-30Length: Very long (&gt; 50 hours)Language: EnglishVoice: Japanese17+ SCREENSHOTS~(˘▾˘~)  DOWNLOAD  (~˘▾˘)~Google Drive - Mega. nzSYSTEM REQUIREMENTSMINIMUM: - OS: Windows 7 or later - Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo - Memory: 2 GB RAM - Graphics: Graphics:"

Though, I guess you can’t really say he’s your partner…”“Obviously. Who’d want someone like him as their partner…”The ones badmouthing Shouhei were Aoi, and Kaho Izumi. It was at this point that several male classmates joined them in trash-talking Shouhei:“Exactly. Why don’t we set up a way for him to confess so he can get rejected and we can move on already?”Their playfulness annoyed Aoi. She pouted, which caused Kaho to start rubbing her breasts, trying to lighten the mood. “Hyah?! Hey… Where do you think you’re… Mmm!”“You’re as sensitive as always, aren’tcha? I love how you’re on the smaller side, too. So cute~”Kaho began to suck on one of Aoi’s smaller-sized hills.

While there were some that chose otherwise, the majority of the youkai decided it was best to become human. It was tough, but as time passed these youkai were able to blend in with the human world and live peacefully amongst them. However, blood is thicker than water. The offspring of these youkai displayed the powerful abilities of their ancestors in times of great anxiety, often manifesting in horrible and dangerous ways, and were labeled by society as monsters.  Officially their condition was named  Acquired Systemic Special Heredity variety Syndrome , or  ASSHS  for short and treated as a non-contagious illness, but the common people began to refer to them as Jinyous (half-youkai) nevertheless.  Of these Jinyous, most were sent to Kamizawa City: an isolated urban area walled off from the rest of Japan to keep all the Jinyous together and away from the human population. However, the ones that were deemed especially dangerous were sent to a medical facility on an uncharted island near the shores of Japan where they would be under constant surveillance. Takabe Ryouichi was one of those who were sent to said island at the age of five. This is a story about him along with the girl called Suzu, his only friend on the island, escaping to Kamizawa city to live a normal life. What they didn’t expect was that Suzu carried a secret that attracted much unwanted attention…Title: AyakashibitoOriginal title: あやかしびとYear: Japanese 2005-06-24, English 2014-04-01Length: Long (30 - 50 hours)Language: EnglishVoice: Japanese18+ SCREENSHOTS~(˘▾˘~)  DOWNLOAD  (~˘▾˘)~Google Drive - Mega. nzSYSTEM REQUIREMENTSMINIMUM:OS: Windows XP or later"

Space has been loosely unified by the Space Federation, a collective with many species participating, including humans. The protagonist, Iris, along with her partner, Mei Li are beautiful lieutenants belonging to the Soviet Security Force, or SSF. They are fearsome ace pilots, calling the SSF's Special Armored Company #101 home. Special Armored Company #101 is a unit that utilize  Armored Knights,  a mobile humanoid weapon. They have been commonly deemed  Armored Warriors,  as the female commanding officer of the company, and the majority of the troops are women, as well. Iris and Mei Li aim to assault and eradicate the rampant human trafficking network present on the planet Left, a planet rooted in extreme discrimination against women. Maintenance of public order, typical of police forces, also falls under the SSF's duties, and the eradication of human trafficking networks is part of the girl's daily obligations. Although, it is true that such efforts have turned in to a stress reliever for the girls, born from their quirky interpretation of justice:  Any and everything goes against evil! One day, cities opposing planet Left's space federation unite and a regional dispute breaks out, seeing cities that fall under the federation's umbrella attacked. The Armored Warriors are dispatched, of course, but during a fierce battle, both Mei Li and Iris' ships are shot down. Iris awakens to find herself captured by an Orc, which are known as hyenas of the battlefield. Iris is then brought to the hostile city of Million, otherwise known as Dark Town, as a slave.

To realize this dream, he accepted a job in Influse Kingdom of investigating some ruins. Unfortunately, he got caught in a cave-in and ended up lost. As he wandered, he came across a girl, sleeping inside a magic stone, Fia. After waking up, Fia told him that she has no memory of herself; however, she knows that she is unmistakably a Goddess. Continuing, she tells Avaro that she could, if she wanted to, move the entirety of the ruins with her Godly powers, and she points out that she has to, no matter what, make it to the closed-off holy ground of the Kingdom. The  Mist Corridor of the Sacred Sound.  Fia, who has said nothing but what could only be nonsense so far, invites Avaro to join her on her journey, saying that he can use these ruins as his workshop however he likes if he does. Although doubtful, Avaro accepts her conditions and becomes the apostle of the self-proclaimed Goddess, and while using the moving ruins as his atelier, they head north. Before long, rumors of the ‘Gualacuna Fortress’ are spread across the country, and while fighting anyone who comes after the fortress, thinking that it has valuables or is a threat, Avaro searches for the truth related to the Goddess’ memories. Along with the Goddess of Marriage, “The Story That Weaves Bonds” marks the beginning. .

Story:  --Now, let's begin my world.  The vampire from the Scarlet Devil Mansion , Remilia Scarlet, suddenly sends her maid,  Sakuya Izayoi  to a parallel universe similar to Gensokyo. A strange world, strange youkai, and unable to use the power to manipulate time. What is Remilia up to……?What's special about this game: ・Time stop system from character's Ability and Gimmick maps that use special abilities like time stop. ・Adapt the  graze  system of the Touhou Project into a 2D game, giving you a sense of tension in approaching to the enemy. ・Graphics that bring out the appeal of Touhou world, such as attractive dot Graphics. A word from the publisher: Team Ladybug began with  Pharaoh Rebirth,  continuing with other enjoyable games including  Resurrection of Beldia  and  Shin Megami Tensei SYNCHRONICITY PROLOGUE.   Since, I have been waiting in anticipation for their next project. This time, they have created a fan fiction game based off the world-renowned  Touhou Project.   From the background to the character's movements and various skills, one can feel the creator's passion for games and love of the Touhou project. While it is a 2D search game similar to Castlevania, the game can easily progress withoutthe insistence of repeat elements or collecting items. This has resulted in a spectacular gameborn from the game production skills cultivated by Team Ladybug. And I personally want to highlight the beauty of the anime sprite.  You can see the attention to detail the creator put into not only the leading character's movements,but the effects and enemy characters.  Touhou Luna Night's is not only for Touhou fans but one that can be enjoyed by anyone who loves 2D action games.

Sensing that fate itself could be at play in their encounter, Osamu resolves to confess his feelings to the older woman, but. . .  Come visit me if you ever find yourself in trouble.  Learning that she runs an apartment complex in a prestigious district of the city, Osamu follows the address he had been given and arrives at the  Terrace House Hinosaka , a run-down boarding house. But once there, he meets not Honoka, but a girl young enough to be her daughter. . . who, in fact, is her actual daughter, Hinosaka Mitoko (height: 144cm). Osamu finds out that while he was busy contemplating fate and his own feelings, Honoka had found another man and eloped, leaving the boarding house to her daughter and a group of eccentric tenants. And so this tall, jobless, well-educated, and allegedly young man starts his life anew under the same roof as an admirable, hard-working, but vertically challenged girl who vehemently objects to the final part of that description. Already overwhelmed by his eccentric new neighbors, Osamu finds himself fending off the inexplicable approaches of a co-worker at his new workplace, opposing the nefarious machinations of a wealthy young woman living nearby, and uncovering the truth about Mitoko's homeroom teacher: a woman with a penchant for wearing black stockings.

Before he died Haruki’s father introduced the young boy to the local establishment in the city called Paradise.

The people are careless, her co-workers are annoying, and thanks to an increasingly tight budget she can hardly do her job. Fed up and burned out, Eve lashes out, but after being transferred to a remote cabin post in return, she only finds herself more uncertain of the value of being a ranger. Soon after arriving, three strange girls corner her in the cabin. Not only do they claim to live there, but they also say they’re the manifestations of Zion, Yellowstone, and Yosemite National Parks! Are these girls really who they say they are? Why is Yosemite so obsessed with her research? And why does one of them have a volcano on their head? Follow Eve as she gets closer with these spritely cuties that put the “natural” in “supernatural,” and maybe even discovers a new kind of love for the parks. Multiple episodes to enjoy!

While If My Heart Had Wings -Flight Diary- is technically a fan disc for If My Heart Had Wings, it includes six stories - including the prologue and epilogue to the main story - and acts as a sort of sequel to the original. There are no common routes, and each respective story is played as a standalone story after selecting it from the startup screen. There are also no branches in the stories. Story:  All people meet in the sky! A group of boys and girls have their first real encounter with the sky - an encounter which provides the foundation for their new shared dream: to soar to the far side of the clouds, on wings into which they've poured their hopes and wishes. The setting is Kazegaura - a lovely little town where the wind blows pleasantly. Today, a boy named Aoi Minase waits for the wind with his friends on a hill lined with windmills. Once again, they await the time for departure - to take off on the sprawling, white wings of a glider. The sky above stretches out to infinity. Their goal: the highest point in the sky possible. Individual Story Details: Inherited Wings: Soaring Club EpilogueThe vivid colors of summer have long become familiar and normal. One boy searches for the continuation to yesterday's answer. . . Aoi has made the decision to quit the club once the summer ends. But the Soaring Club is now faced by a certain problem. It's the sort of problem for which answers will not come easily. Kotori is plagued with anxiety. In this place to which she had once escaped, she had found hope - the hope to dream. But it's that very dream itself that she now can't seem to find. . . This is the tale of Kotori and Aoi, two birds locked in a cage, finding the courage to spread their wings to their own  next sky . Wings of Dreams: Soaring Club PrologueThe wings of dreams fly on a new wind. Amane has found the answer she was promised. Her dream of crossing through the corridor of the clouds together with her new friends has been fulfilled. She's filled with nostalgic memories. . . Isuka's heart pounds as she hears this. With everyone so radiant, she feels an overwhelming sense of pressure and pain.  I want to experience this miraculous sky, one more time. . .  Thus begins the prologue to a new tale about friends managing to come together once again. Inexpressible Emotion: HotaruThe story of Hotaru Himegi. Production is underway on a promotional video to pique the interest of next year's batch of new students. In the process, a mistake on Hotaru's part causes Aoi to injure his knee. Haunted by a feeling of responsibility for the accident, Hotaru volunteers to help out Aoi's mother at Flying Fish Manor.  I'll do anything. Please, just ask - Master Ao-nii.  Unfamiliar Answer: KanakoThe story of Kanako Sigure. A typhoon has forced the postponement of the first test flight of the school year. Apart from the occasional spot of trouble here and there, it was a regular day like any other. As Kanako wakes up in the morning, she immediately realizes that she hadn't been sleeping in her own bed - but Aoi's. A young man and woman spending an entire night alone together. It would actually be stranger if nothing whatsoever had happened. . .  Have I. . . made a mistake? The Kazato Sisters: A Day in the LifeThis story takes place after you begin dating the Kazato sisters in the main story. The Day I Found My WingsIn this story you can read the events of the main story in a novel written from Kotori's perspective.

From that day on, she was referred to as “Terra”.  Without a primary ruler to oversee her children, Ateon soon fell into chaos and the First Valkyrian War was recorded in history.  The Valkyrie were sacred creatures that would fuse themselves with warriors, imbuing the chosen ones with fantastic powers to defeat true evil. From the ashes of war, the Kingdom of Rose was born. The tenacious people sought to unite the world under one rule. They aimed their blades at any who would go against them. Purging the world of imperfections in hopes that it will summon Terra back to their world. Centuries later, in pursuit of absolute perfection, the Kingdom of Rose continued its conquest. Emperor Tobias Rosenthal developed a ruthless system to breed out all disobedience. The youth were the main target. If any blemish was found on a student, they would be purged. As more and more lands were conquered, the Way of the Rose also spread, creating a vast utopia under strict enforcement. As we begin our story, Ascanius Rosenthal races towards school. With death used as a constant reminder, one would imagine students would take great care to arrive to their class way ahead of schedule. However, for Ascanius, his uncanny ability to survive by the narrowest of margins impedes his decision making. Especially when it comes to extra sleep.

    "body": "2019/05/29 - TRAILERABOUT THIS GAMEHeart of the Woods is a fantasy yuri visual novel about paranormal investigation, ancient mysteries, and a love between two girls that transcends life and death. Maddie Raines has had enough. After years of serving as manager, editor, and general business-handler for her best friend Tara's popular paranormal vlog channel, she's finally ready to move forward with her own life. But when she agrees to take one last trip with Tara to the mysterious village of Eysenfeld, she's suddenly swept up in a dangerous supernatural crisis that will change the course of both of their lives forever. A strange young woman named Morgan has promised them undeniable proof of real paranormal phenomena, and what she has to offer eclipses anything they’d ever seen before. However, out of all the strange occurrences the three of them bear witness to, one in particular captivates Maddie in a way she’s never been before: the ghost of a young woman. This woman is Abigail, the victim of a centuries-old injustice now bound eternally to the forest surrounding Eysenfeld. Drawn to Maddie in a way she can’t explain, Abigail reveals herself to another person for the first time in more than 200 years. While Tara and Morgan investigate the mysteries surrounding the village itself, Maddie begins to form a bond with Abigail that grows to be more intense than any bond she’s felt before. As she learns the truth about Abigail’s death and imprisonment, she realizes that it falls to her and her friends to break the curse that has ruled over Eysenfeld for centuries. But more importantly than that, it falls to her to finally free the woman she loves. A part-time manager, part time video editor, and full-time babysitter, Maddie has the thankless job of handling the absolute whirlwind that is her best friend. She’s professional, meticulous and intellectual; the first person to turn to when a problem needs solving. But when their investigation entangles her in an ancient curse, she's forced to confront phenomena beyond her comprehension, and more importantly, her own self doubt. For the last two centuries, the ghost of a young woman has haunted the forests of Eysenfeld. That ghost is Abigail, a kind and playful soul forcibly bound to the forest as part of an ancient curse.  Two hundred years of wishing for a life cruelly denied to her have led to a feeling of crushing loneliness and one overwhelming desire: to finally have someone to talk to. One of the world’s most popular paranormal vloggers (according to her), Tara is unfailingly charismatic and bursting with limitless energy. She’s brash, intrepid, and always seeking something new. That often makes her a magnet for trouble: whether it’s from relentless flirting, minor criminal activities or just plain pig-headedness, things around Tara have a tendency to end in chaos. A loyal Taranormal viewer and the daughter of Eysenfeld’s mayor, Morgan is. . . different. When not running her small and mostly empty antique shop, she’s known to disappear into the woods for days at a time. That, combined with her resistance to traditional social standards, has caused her to develop a bit of a notorious reputation in the village. However, this resistance is not just an act of rebellion: Morgan knows that there’s something sinister deep within Eysenfeld, and she’s not going to stop until she tears it out at the roots. -Incredible character and CG art from Rosuuri-Fully original backgrounds and soundtrack-Approximately 130,000 words with multiple endings-Ending theme from In Love With A Ghost-Multiple accessibility options-Steam trading cards-Extra features including a music room, CG viewer, and guest art gallery-At least one really, really gay ghostSCREENSHOTS~(˘▾˘~)  DOWNLOAD  (~˘▾˘)~Google Drive - Mega. nz. 18+ Patch for All-ages, Steam versionGoogle DriveSYSTEM REQUIREMENTSMINIMUM:OS: Windows XPProcessor: 1 GHz Intel or AMD ProcessorMemory: 1024 MB RAMGraphics: OpenGL or DirectX Compatible Graphics CardDirectX: Version 9. 0cStorage: 2 GB available space"

She lived her life much like any other person her age, but one day, she was caught up in an explosion while returning home on the train alongside her friend, Hitsuji Naomi. In an attempt to save her friend's life, she shields her on instinct the moment the explosion goes off, losing her life in the process. However, before she knew it, she was back at Lion House, happily chatting with her friends as if nothing had happened in the first place. A few days later, she found herself in a strange world. Here she met Parca, an odd girl claiming to be a goddess. It turns out that she had somehow become a participant in Divine Selection, a ritual carried out over twelve weeks by twelve people, which allowed them to compete in order to undo their deaths. What shocked Rinka most of all, however, was the presence of her friend Mishima Miharu amongst the twelve. In order to make it through Divine Selection, one must eliminate others by gathering information regarding their name, cause of death and regret in the real world, then  electing  them. This turn of events would lead to her learning about the truth behind her death, as well as her own personal regrets. She would also come to face the reality that Miharu was willing to throw her life away for her sake, as well as the extents to which the other participants would go to in order to live through to the end. Far more experiences than she ever could have imagined awaited her now, but where will her resolve lead her once all is said and done. . . ? SCREENSHOTS~(˘▾˘~)  DOWNLOAD  (~˘▾˘)~Google Drive - Mega. nzSYSTEM REQUIREMENTSMINIMUM:OS: Windows 7 or later"

Now, the villainous Wilhelm Ehrenburg takes front and center stage, his night of bloodstained roses painting a crimson tale of action and despair. The setting of this gripping story? The final months of World War II. Features the return of  Dies irae ~Amantes amentes~  writer Takashi Masada and artist G Yuusuke. ＜STORY＞:  My mother was my sister.  Brooklyn, New York - The man who sat across the interviewer at the vampire bar known as the  Borges House  began his story with those odd words. Following the end World War II, the pallid SS officer traversed the globe to many a raging battlefield, leaving carnage unforeseen in his wake. The vampire of the battlefield. The wandering Hakenkreuz. Though his saga was passed down as naught but a stale ghost story, it was no mere urban legend. For he was Wilhelm Ehrenburg - hunted in absolute secrecy by the UN as a remnant of the Third Reich, enemy of the world, and one of the infamous members of the demonic Longinus Dreizehn Orden.  And after over half a century, the time had finally come for him to depart for Japan in order to fulfill his most ardent desire. Humoring this interviewer he would have ignored or slain any other day was merely a whim birthed from the exaltation of the promised time drawing ever closer. That was the only reason our intrepid interviewer found him in a talkative mood. Thus, as he reflected on his life, Wilhelm grew nostalgic - sentimental, even - for the path he had walked.  And when asked, he unveiled his past piece by piece. From the accursed blood that poisoned his very soul, to the blight wrought by the works of Mercury. He spun a tale of the day he awakened to the truth of his being, and of the woman who had the nature of Wilhelm's existence engraved upon her very being.  Don't you worry, I'm gonna tell you everything. From the first moment I met her, to the very end of our story.  ＜Game Features＞: All new side story in the universe of  Dies irae ~Amantes amentes~ , starring Wilhelm Ehrenburg.

The first part of the move also parries incoming attacks, working as both an offensive and defensive move![Break Hold] A convenient counter technique that can also be used while the player is heavily stunned. It should only be used in tight situations due to its light-damage output. [Fatal Rush]A powerful combo with a dramatic finishing move, activated by consecutively pressing the [RB] button. While it is made to be easy to use for beginner players, it can also be employed in more than one creative way by the experienced competitors. [New Danger Zones][Rumble Danger]If knocked into onlookers, they will push the player back into the center of the stage. It is a trap that combines the atmosphere of a real street fight with strategy. [Mass-Destruction]If the opponent is knocked back into a large stack of boxes or barrels with a “Break Blow” or ”Fatal Rush” it will cause a large chain-explosion.

Years later, an uneasy calm has descended on humanity, although a state of war still technically exists. Four power blocs that share control of the Moon and the earth, each looking for a weakness they can exploit against the others. You are Captain Leiji Osumi of the Free Alliance Space Force, formerly a fighter pilot in the War. Your past is haunted by a terrible incident that caused you to change careers, transferring to the top secret intelligence division. When a series of technical problems on the Free Alliance Moon Base D-02 hint at sabotage, you are dispatched to get to the bottom of things, under the cover of  Technical Advisor.  The military learned long ago that women are better adapted to lonely assignments in space, and so the base is staffed almost entirely by females. Arriving at the base, you discover that an inexplicable sexual insanity has gripped its normally professional staff, prompting further investigation. Are these strange occurrences connected with the sabotage somehow? You have to untangle the mystery and get things back on track before one of the other power blocs notices that anything is amiss and tries to attack.

By doing so, colorless objects become red and regain the essence of time. You will also need to make use of the giant’s super strength by lifting and throwing objects to clear your path. Every stage is a puzzle waiting to be pieced together. The further you get, the harder it becomes, but the greater the risk, the bigger the reward. Discover how to solve each stage as you delve deeper into the story’s grim origins. Key Features:Color &amp; Time - Without color and time, the player cannot progress, but with Rose's power you can take advantage of both these key elements. Blood Memories - Splatters of blood are waiting to be found all throughout the castle, and each one contains a gruesome death. Visual Storytelling - Collect Blood Memories to unlock the past by watching a series of vignettes pieced together by each victim's death. Live, Die, Repeat - Utilize both Rose's and the giant's power to solve each stage, but if death happens to cut your journey short, be careful not to make the same mistake twice.

Akiba,  for short.  This suburban Tokyo ward's seen it all, from Japan's post-war reconstruction to the economic bubblegum crisis of the '80s. Always on the cutting edge of progress, with a little something to offer even the most fetishistic of appetites, it was almost inevitable that this singular technocracy of indulgence would give birth to a whole new kind of appetite altogether.  Enter, the “Synthisters” – vampires who prey upon the life energy of the town’s unsuspecting figurine-chasers, maid café connoisseurs and cosplayers. Those victimized by Synthisters take on the properties of their attackers while also withdrawing from society and becoming veritable shut-ins due to their newfound fatal weakness to sunlight.  AKIBA’S TRIP tells the story of one such unfortunate soul: a young man named Nanashi who was lured into a trap by the promise of rare character goods and transformed into one of the walking undead. He, however, was spared the worst of his fate by the bloody kiss of a mysterious Synthister hunter named Shizuku. Together with the rest of his companions in an organization unofficially dubbed the “Akiba Freedom Fighters,” Nanashi and Shizuku must uncover the truth behind the Synthister plague and save Akiba from being overrun by violent, antisocial energy vampires.  And of course, the best way to fight vampires is to strip them down to their skivvies so they melt in the noonday sun…KEY FEATURESFaithful Recreation of Japan’s Electronics Mecca Like a virtual tour of Tokyo’s Akihabara district, all major outdoor locations from the town have been painfully recreated, with over 130 real-life shops accurately represented.  Unique and Customizable Brawler-Style Combat Anything can be a weapon, from baseball bats to comics to motherboards, and individual clothing items may be targeted, stripped and added to the player’s own inventory.  Satirical Story with Divergent Paths and Multiple Endings Playing off common anime and video game tropes for social satire, the player’s choices determine how the story progresses, leading to one of many unique endings.  Modern Day Setting Enhances Gameplay Options and Adds Pop Culture Feel The in-game smartphone is used to check email, read comments on “Pitter,” take side quests, catalog ad flyers, launch apps to identify the undead and much, much more.  *Please note that the buildings and monuments depicted in the game AKIBA'S TRIP are based on the Akihabara town area from the fall of 2012 through the summer of 2013. *Screenshots (Click on image to view full size).
