He is an elderly man of 65, physically dependent on his live-in nursing assistant. However, when aroused he shows his true colors as the "God Killer." His massive armor piercing rifle is one of his professional trademarks.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />- Weapon: Armor piercing rifle<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><strong style="margin:0;padding:0;">Garcian Smith</strong><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />The leader of 7 different personalities and also a loyal servant of Haman. He's low-key and nothing's ever humorous to him. He uses his special telegnosis ability to search and destroy the Heaven Smiles that use optical camouflage.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />- Weapon: Handgun with Silencer<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><strong style="margin:0;padding:0;">Dan Smith</strong><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />The most aggressive personality with the biggest attitude out of the 7. He's dressed cool with a suit and tie. No one will mistake him for a business man, at least not with his big revolver he carries all the time. There is hatred in his eyes. Some even say that if you stare into his eyes, you can see the devil.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />- Weapon: Custom Magnum<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><strong style="margin:0;padding:0;">Mask de Smith</strong><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />A mysterious former professional wrestler, he managed to build quite a following with this unique blend of Lucha Libre and British Lancashire style wrestling. There are rumors of his rampaging maskless through the ranks of the No Holds Barred circuit as well. Just when he had been invited to New York to appear at the main event, he vanished without a trace. His specialty move is known as the Smith Special (usually referred to in wrestling circles as the "burning hammer.") His double grenade launchers pack a powerful punch and can fire normal, Electric, and Gravity grenades. Animals naturally flock to the young and kind-hearted Babyface.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />- Weapon: Double Grenade Launchers<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><strong style="margin:0;padding:0;">Coyote Smith</strong><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />Like a venomous serpent, he's a cold-blooded personality. A Latino thug who knows his ways in the streets. Coyote is synonymous with the "art of lock-picking." He's a man who knows how to get things. It's this extraordinary skill that qualifies him as a member of the Smithe Alliance. Also worth mentioning is his ability to take lives brutally.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />- Weapon: Custom Revolver<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><strong style="margin:0;padding:0;">Kevin Smith</strong><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />This albino man uses a knife as his weapon of choice. He can disappear into thin air by taking off his shades. He favors solitude over harmony. They say he's not a man of many words. But in actuality, no one has ever heard him speak.

Because she lives a life so close to death, her ability to survive life-or-death situations is beyond that of any living man. Her specialty is long-range shooting.

On a personal level she's very passive and tends to keep her distance from others.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />- Weapon: Automatic Pistol with Scope<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" /><strong style="margin:0;padding:0;">Con Smith</strong><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />The blind boy Con has exceptional hearing that allows him to visualize sounds. He also has an awesome rapid-fire ability. Another nice attribute is his super running speed that if he wanted could outrun almost any enemy. When he's asleep, he's just an average child. Nobody would suspect him of being an elite assassin.<br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />- Weapon: Double Automatics</span><br /><h2 class="bb_tag" style="background-image:none;background-position:left bottom;background-repeat:no-repeat;font-weight:normal;line-height:26px;margin:18px 0 0;padding:2px 0 0;"><span style="background-color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:small;">ENEMY PROFILE</span></h2><span style="background-color:white;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong style="margin:0;padding:0;">Kun Lan</strong><br style="margin:0;padding:0;" />A parasitic avatar from Haman Smith's past.
