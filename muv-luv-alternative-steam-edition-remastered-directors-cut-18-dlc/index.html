<meta name="description" content="TRAILERABOUT THIS GAMEMuv-Luv Alternative is a direct sequel to Muv-Luv Unlimited, and is the grand finale of the Muv-Luv trilogy.This page contains spoilers to the first game, so if this is your first time hearing about Muv-Luv series, we recommend playing Muv-Luv first.About Muv-Luv Alternative:This is it. The chips are down, the die’s been cast, and the fate of the multiverse is on the line. Step back into the cockpit and prepare for deployment in Muv-Luv Alternative, the most critically acclaimed visual novel of all time. Just be sure to keep a box of tissues handy, because it’s about to be a bumpy ride.This isn’t a cutesy high school rom-com anymore; it’s an epic tale of political conspiracies, international espionage, an alien menace, quantum causality, bittersweet reunions, genetic modification, and much, much more. Gluttons for punishment, rejoice, because once it gets rolling, there are no brakes on this pain train. It’ll test your limits, challenge your worldview, and by the time it’s all over, you’ll be so emotionally spent that it’ll be weeks before you can fully process the implications of what you’ve just witnessed. Fair warning, though: common side effects include feelings of emptiness, PTSD, and unrealistic expectations for any and all other visual novels.This definitive release comes complete with a brand new translation, all-new CGs, additional voice acting, and dual language/ tablet support, so if you think you’re ready to take the dive, there’s never been a better time to strap in and see for yourself why so many readers consider this the greatest story ever told.The Story So Far(PLEASE NOTE: The following section contains major spoilers for the previous installment in the franchise. Muv-Luv Alternative picks up where the events of the original Muv-Luv left off, and certain scenes will play out differently depending on your choices in the first game. To get the most out of the Muv-Luv experience, we highly recommend that you complete the original game before starting Muv-Luv Alternative. Click here to jump to the game’s product page on Steam.)Three years have passed since the day Takeru, an unsuspecting Japanese high-schooler, suddenly awoke in a world not his own — a war-torn alternate reality in which mankind was on the brink of extinction, locked in a decades-long struggle against the ruthless extra-terrestrial invaders known only as the BETA. In that time, he’s been through an awful lot — enlisting in the military, meeting parallel-universe versions of his old friends, and even falling in love. But unbeknownst to Takeru, he and his squadmates were being trained to participate in a top-secret UN contingency plan known as Alternative IV — a last-ditch effort to take back the Earth via experimental technology. Unfortunately, however, development screeched to a halt when the project’s chief executive, Professor Kouzuki, hit a wall in her research due to technological constraints. With tensions rising, and pressure to shift gears from governments all across the world, the UN delegation opted to scrap the project in favor of its successor: Alternative V. This was humanity’s last resort — a plan that utilized all of their remaining resources to build a migrant fleet of interstellar craft, allowing a tiny fraction of the population to abandon the Earth in the hopes of finding life anew in another star system. Takeru and his comrades-in-arms were among those left behind, condemned to death by their fellow man.But it seems the hand of fate has bigger plans for Takeru, because it’s at this point that he wakes up to find himself back in his childhood bedroom once again. Not in his own world, mind you — but back where he was first spat out into this hellscape three years prior. This was no dream; this was a recurring nightmare. But then it hits him: this is a second chance. If he’s truly been sent back in time, then he’s the only one who knows of the impending doom that awaits this world. Perhaps he can use this knowledge to warn Professor Kouzuki, and together, they can somehow find a way to prevent Alternative V from ever being enacted. And who knows? If he can change history, then maybe — just maybe — he’ll find the answers to all of his questions. Why has he gone back in time? Why isn’t Sumika here? And most importantly, what IS Alternative IV?Features:Linear Visual Novel - Unlike the first two parts, Muv-Luv Alternative is almost designed as a straightforward interactive premiere movie, complete with voice acting, subtitles, and intense music, perfectly fitting for a finale.Over 50-70 hours reading time.Available in three languages - Japanese, English and Simplified Chinese.The UI has been reworked, so it&#39;s compatible with the newest tablet PCs and touchscreens.User save data are stored in Steam cloud so readers can continue their progress anywhere with ease.Title: Muv-Luv AlternativeOriginal title: マブラヴ オルタネイティヴYear: Japan 2006-02-24, English 2017-09-19Length: Very long (&gt; 50 hours)Language: EnglishVoice: Japanese18+ Edition!SCREENSHOTS~(˘▾˘~)  DOWNLOAD  (~˘▾˘)~(Director&#39;s Cut 18+ DLC patch are included)Google Drive - Mega.nzSYSTEM REQUIREMENTSMINIMUM: - OS: Windows 7 or later" />

Just be sure to keep a box of tissues handy, because it’s about to be a bumpy ride.</span><br /><br /><span>This isn’t a cutesy high school rom-com anymore; it’s an epic tale of political conspiracies, international espionage, an alien menace, quantum causality, bittersweet reunions, genetic modification, and much, much more. Gluttons for punishment, rejoice, because once it gets rolling, there are no brakes on this pain train. It’ll test your limits, challenge your worldview, and by the time it’s all over, you’ll be so emotionally spent that it’ll be weeks before you can fully process the implications of what you’ve just witnessed. Fair warning, though: common side effects include feelings of emptiness, PTSD, and unrealistic expectations for any and all other visual novels.</span><br /><br /><span>This definitive release comes complete with a brand new translation, all-new CGs, additional voice acting, and dual language/ tablet support, so if you think you’re ready to take the dive, there’s never been a better time to strap in and see for yourself why so many readers consider this the greatest story ever told.</span></span></div><h2 class="bb_tag"><span style="background-color:white;"><span style="color:blue;">The Story So Far</span></span></h2><div class="separator" style="clear:both;"><span style="background-color:white;"><span>(PLEASE NOTE: The following section contains major spoilers for the previous installment in the franchise. Muv-Luv Alternative picks up where the events of the original Muv-Luv left off, and certain scenes will play out differently depending on your choices in the first game. To get the most out of the Muv-Luv experience, we highly recommend that you complete the original game before starting Muv-Luv Alternative. Click </span><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/802880/MuvLuv/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">here</a><span> to jump to the game’s product page on Steam.)</span><br /><br /><span>Three years have passed since the day Takeru, an unsuspecting Japanese high-schooler, suddenly awoke in a world not his own — a war-torn alternate reality in which mankind was on the brink of extinction, locked in a decades-long struggle against the ruthless extra-terrestrial invaders known only as the BETA. In that time, he’s been through an awful lot — enlisting in the military, meeting parallel-universe versions of his old friends, and even falling in love. But unbeknownst to Takeru, he and his squadmates were being trained to participate in a top-secret UN contingency plan known as Alternative IV — a last-ditch effort to take back the Earth via experimental technology. Unfortunately, however, development screeched to a halt when the project’s chief executive, Professor Kouzuki, hit a wall in her research due to technological constraints. With tensions rising, and pressure to shift gears from governments all across the world, the UN delegation opted to scrap the project in favor of its successor: Alternative V. This was humanity’s last resort — a plan that utilized all of their remaining resources to build a migrant fleet of interstellar craft, allowing a tiny fraction of the population to abandon the Earth in the hopes of finding life anew in another star system. Takeru and his comrades-in-arms were among those left behind, condemned to death by their fellow man.</span><br /><br /><span>But it seems the hand of fate has bigger plans for Takeru, because it’s at this point that he wakes up to find himself back in his childhood bedroom once again. Not in his own world, mind you — but back where he was first spat out into this hellscape three years prior. This was no dream; this was a recurring nightmare. But then it hits him: this is a second chance. If he’s truly been sent back in time, then he’s the only one who knows of the impending doom that awaits this world. Perhaps he can use this knowledge to warn Professor Kouzuki, and together, they can somehow find a way to prevent Alternative V from ever being enacted. And who knows? If he can change history, then maybe — just maybe — he’ll find the answers to all of his questions. Why has he gone back in time? Why isn’t Sumika here? And most importantly, what IS Alternative IV?</span></span></div><h2 class="bb_tag"><span style="background-color:white;"><span style="color:blue;">Features:</span></span></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li style="margin:0 0 8px;padding:0;"><span style="background-color:white;"><strong style="margin:0;padding:0;">Linear Visual Novel</strong> - Unlike the first two parts, Muv-Luv Alternative is almost designed as a straightforward interactive premiere movie, complete with voice acting, subtitles, and intense music, perfectly fitting for a finale.</span></li><li style="margin:0 0 8px;padding:0;"><span style="background-color:white;">Over <strong style="margin:0;padding:0;">50-70 hours reading time.</strong></span></li><li style="margin:0 0 8px;padding:0;"><span style="background-color:white;"><strong style="margin:0;padding:0;">Available in three languages </strong>- Japanese, English and Simplified Chinese.</span></li><li style="margin:0 0 8px;padding:0;"><span style="background-color:white;">The UI has been reworked, so it's compatible with the newest tablet PCs and touchscreens.</span></li><li style="margin:0 0 8px;padding:0;"><span style="background-color:white;">User save data are stored in Steam cloud so readers can continue their progress anywhere with ease.</span></li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear:both;"><br /></div></div><div style="text-align:left;"><span><span style="color:#274e13;">Title:</span> Muv-Luv Alternative</span><br /><span><span style="color:#274e13;">Original title:</span> マブラヴ オルタネイティヴ</span><br /><span><span style="color:#274e13;">Year:</span> Japan 2006-02-24, English 2017-09-19</span><br /><span><span style="color:#274e13;">Length:</span> Very long (&gt;
